## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I managed to count how many unread notifiations are really there, not just 3 as was required.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried to use such a thing as aria-label for my button.

### Continued development

This challenge was not so difficult for me but there were some tricky moments and I will return to it later to think about connection between my dot-icons and background of unread notifications.
